# Stereo Vision

## Description

Given a set of 2 images of the same object from two different camera angles, this project attempts to draw the disparity and depth map.


## Data

* Images of the same object from different camera angles

* Camera Parameters


## Approach

* Feature matching using Orb Feature Matching

* Compute the Fundamental Matrix using point correspondences (Least Squares as well as RANSAC approach)

* Compute the Essential Matrix from the Fundamental Matrix

* Decompose the Essential Matrix to get the Rotation and Translation matrices

* Find the Perspective Transforms of the two images with respect to each other

* Warp the two images based on these transforms for Rectification (Vectorized implementation)

* Compute the Epipolar Lines for these rectified images based on the point correspondences

* Using a sliding window approach, found the minimum of the Sum of Squared Distance for a specified window size in a single row and found window correspondences.

* The disparity was found using thje difference in the pixel locations.

* The differences were sclaed between 0 - 255 and this was plotted on a grayscale image. Heatmap conversion of the disparity map was also displayed.

* Based on the triangulation formula, the depth of the points was found and a similar grayscale was well as heat map was created.

### Executing program

* Clone the repository into any folder of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/ninadharish/Stereo-Vision.git
```

* Open the repository and navigate to the `src` folder.
